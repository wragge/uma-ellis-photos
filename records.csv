John Ellis describes the strike and his role in it: This strike was the result of a breakdown in negotiations between the Printing and Kindred Industries Union (PKIU) and the Newspaper Proprietors' Association (NPA). The Age workers were also on strike. The issue at the centre of the dispute was computerisation of typesetting and make-up in the composing room and whether non-union labour (staff) could operate the equipment. Even though John had been employed at Herald Gravure Printers for 16-17 years he maintained that because he was a typesetter/comp his allegiance was with the chapel members at Flinders St. After all, any gains that the Herald chapel made would flow on to him. Herald Gravure Printers management didn't agree with his view naturally, but he was adamant and went on a one-man strike. The strike lasted almost two weeks and in that time he spent many hours (day and night) on the picket line. He slept at the Dalton's in Canning St. on a few occasions as it was convenient to be on the picket line at short notice. Staff from all the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd's subsidiaries were expected to work their equipment and drive delivery trucks, etc., to get the paper out. The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd and Fairfax (The Age) also brought in trained female typists from Sydney to work the typesetting equipment. As well as this, they also had to contend with a huge police presence which ensured that the trucks went out. Negotiators won some concessions but by and large they lost control of a large amount of typesetting work to non-union labor.

John Ellis describes the strike and his role in it: ""This strike was the result of a breakdown in negotiations between the Printing and Kindred Industries Union (PKIU) and the Newspaper Proprietors' Association (NPA). The Age workers were also on strike. The issue at the centre of the dispute was computerisation of typesetting and make-up in the composing room and whether non-union labour (staff) could operate the equipment. Even though I had been employed at Herald Gravure Printers for 16-17 years I maintained that because I was a typesetter/comp my allegiance was with the chapel members at Flinders St. After all, any gains that the Herald chapel made would flow on to me. Herald Gravure Printers management didn't agree with my view naturally, but I was adamant and went on a one-man strike. The strike lasted almost two weeks and in that time I spent many hours (day and night) on the picket line. I slept at the Dalton's in Canning St. on a few occasions as it was convenient to be on the picket line at short notice. Staff from all the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd's subsidiaries were expected to work our equipment and drive delivery trucks, etc., to get the paper out. The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd and Fairfax (The Age) also brought in trained female typists from Sydney to work the typesetting equipment.

Our negotiators won some concessions but by and large we lost control of a large amount of typesetting work to non-union labor. When I returned to work at Herald Gravure Printers the manager, Jack Dempsey, called me to his office. Tony Duggan was with him and they went through the whole episode of my role on the picket line. I was told me that head office (Flinders St) wanted me sacked because of my radical behaviour. I agreed with most of what he said regarding the taking of pics of senior management of the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, (Sir Philip Jones, who came down to observe the picket, was particularly upset); I was trying to get a shot of him with some of the ""toads"" from the comp room (see pic. 31). I remained silent until he finished speaking then asked him what he was going to do. I told him he could do one of two things: he could sack me, which would embroil him in a strike at Herald Gravure Printers or he could let things simmer down and hope that the problem would go away. I was pretty confident that I had them over a barrel as I was in the middle of some very large jobs and that the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd annual report was due any day. Although the management resented my politics (to say the least) they relied on my integrity and skill to do many of their most confidential jobs, e.g., prospectus, submissions, balance sheets, etc. I left his office and never heard another word about the episode.
